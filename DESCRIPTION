Version: 0.2.0
Title: Gaussian Process Panel Modeling
Description: Provides an implementation of Gaussian process panel modeling (GPPM). 
              GPPM is described in Karch (2016; <DOI:10.18452/17641>) and Karch, Brandmaier & Voelkle (2018; <DOI:10.17605/OSF.IO/KVW5Y>).
              Essentially, GPPM is Gaussian process based modeling of longitudinal panel data.
              'gppm' also supports regular Gaussian process regression (with a focus on flexible model specification), and multi-task learning.
